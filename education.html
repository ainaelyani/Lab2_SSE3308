                    My primary school was where I built the foundation for my education and created many unforgettable
                    memories.
                    It was here that I learned to make friends, perform basic calculations, and so much more.
                    I also took my first big exam, the UPSR, during this time.
                    Although I felt a bit disappointed because I didnâ€™t achieve my target results, that experience
                    became a
                    stepping stone
                    to doing better in secondary school.

                <p>My secondary school was a time of significant growth, where I expanded my academic knowledge,
                    developed
                    essential skills, and overcame new challenges. During this time, I took the PT3 and SPM exams, and,
                    drawing from my previous experience with the UPSR, I finally achieved excellent results in both
                    exams.

                <h4>Centre for Foundation Studies in Science, University of Malaya</h4>
                <p>I decided to pursue a Foundation program after SPM, as it is one of the fastest ways to achieve a
                    degree.
                    The Foundation program provided me with a comprehensive introduction to my chosen field of study,
                    helping me build essential academic skills and knowledge that would prepare me for university-level
                    coursework.

                <h4>University Putra Malaysia</h4>
                <p>After completing my Foundation program, I pursued a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. This
                    course has allowed me to dive deep into the world of programming, software development, and system
                    design, providing me with the technical skills and knowledge necessary to excel in the ever-evolving
                    field of technology.
