            My name is Nuraina Elyani and I’m currently a 2nd year
            student at Universiti Putra Malaysia, pursuing a Bachelor of Software Engineering with Honors. As the
            first child in my family, I’ve always been driven to set a good example and strive for excellence in
            everything I do. I have a deep passion for technology, coding and solving problems. I'm eager to use
            these skills to make a meaningful impact. <br>

            <br>I'm actively building my tech experience alongside my studies by working on mini projects during
            semester
            breaks. While I enjoy software development, my ultimate goal is to become a data analyst. I'm passionate
            about
            uncovering trends and insights through data and I'm eager to keep growing my skills through side projects
            and
            learning opportunities <br>

            <br>Looking ahead, I’m excited to apply my skills in data analysis and software engineering to create
            innovative
            tech solutions. I'm eager to collaborate, learn and take on challenges that drive personal and professional
            growth. My goal is to help organizations make data-driven decisions through my technical expertise and
            passion
            for data.
