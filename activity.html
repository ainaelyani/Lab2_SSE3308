            <p>My friend and I participated in the selection to represent our faculty in the badminton competition. I
                played doubles. Although it was a bit tiring since I donâ€™t play sports often, it was a lot of fun.
                Through the game, I learned the importance of teamwork and communication, especially in doubles. I also
                realized the need for better endurance and practice to improve my skills. The experience taught me how
                to stay focused under pressure and how much coordination is required between partners to succeed in the
                game.

            <p>To enhance my knowledge and skills for my career journey, I participated in an industry visit to Huawei.
                This visit provided valuable insights into the latest advancements in technology and the inner workings
                of a global leader in innovation. I had the opportunity to explore Huawei's cutting-edge products and
                solutions, as well as gain a deeper understanding of the company's operations and its approach to
                research and development. Additionally, the experience allowed me to engage with industry professionals
                and learn about the trends shaping the future of technology. Overall, this visit was an enriching
                experience that broadened my perspective and inspired me to continue learning and growing in my field.

            <p>To achieve skills beyond academics, I joined the multimedia committee for the LensCrafter program. As
                a committee member, I was responsible for capturing key moments throughout the program by taking photos
                and preparing video recaps. This role allowed me to develop my photography and videography skills, while
                also gaining experience in editing and content creation. I learned how to work under tight deadlines,
                collaborate with team members, and ensure that the visual content effectively represented the essence of
                the program. Overall, this experience not only helped me improve my technical skills but also taught me
                the importance of creativity, attention to detail and effective communication in multimedia production.
