            <p>For my first mini-project, I developed an Inventory Management System that can help small stores
                efficiently track and manage their stock. The goal was to create a user-friendly application that would
                allow users to easily add, remove, and update inventory items, keeping track of the quantity and
                description of each product. This mini project gave me practical experience in managing a complete
                application, from the design phase to implementation, and helped me better understand the principles of
                programming, database integration and user interface design.

            <p>Working on My DebtZero System was an incredibly valuable experience, especially in a group setting. I
                learned
                how to collaborate effectively with team members, leveraging each personâ€™s strengths to achieve our
                shared goal. We faced challenges but by sharing ideas, discussing solutions and supporting each other,
                we were able to overcome them and successfully complete the project. My DebtZero System, is a
                comprehensive
                application for managing debts and loans, encompassing the entire system including functionalities for
                account registration, debt requests and approvals, transaction management, balance checking, debt detail
                viewing and payment scheduling for various user roles.
